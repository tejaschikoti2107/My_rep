# Battery casing for Lipo batteries

## Description
Lipo batteries are used in many electronic gadgets as they are rechargable,light-weight,and provides more power for the devices to function but there is a downside to it though they acheive all the above mentioned conditions they are difficult to handle,expensive,and if we dont take good care they can burst into flames.This is the main motivation behind designing the battery casing for Lipo batteries.So ideally we need a battery case that prevents explosion of the battery to fair extent and prevents damage to the electronic device we are using.Here, we present a design that is compatible with the 6S lipo battery 5000mAh and can hold two batteries safely.

## Compenents

#### Voltage monitor
This will be used to measure the voltage between two terminals of the battery and will be useful for checking the health of the battery so that we know when to recharge them.
This is situated on the chassis and is enclosed by a galss covering firmly so that the circuitry of the voltage monitor is not exposed to the outside.
#### Rocket switch 
This is used for for controlling the battery discharge into the robot.In the on state it will allow current to flow i.e discharging and in the off state it will not allow current to flow creating a break in the circuit.
#### The chassis
The chassis is a rectangular frame and has two velcro straps attached to it so that the xt60 connector used can be held steadily without any movement.It also has a mounting for the voltage monitor and the rocket switch.It has strong magnets and a thin deposition of metal so that the magnet can stick to that place perfectly.It has space for air to leave and has a opening in its bottom in its full occupancy state also.It has two handles so that it can be firmly mounted on the robot,it also allows to easily carry the battery casing with the hands.The chassis will be made of ABS plastic and the protrusions can be made of metal so that it is firm 
#### Battery holders
The battery holders are made from sheet metal so that it can attach to the magnet strongly.It has 4 rubber pads 2 of them placed near the battery and 2 of them placed are placed 
near the edge to give the battery enough space to expand.The rubber pads are attached to the sheet metal using a double sided tape.The 2 of the rubber pads placed near the edge will have springs starting from the end of it and going all the way to the battery.There are 3 springs on each rubber pad to prevent the battery from shaking and hence limiting the freedom of movement of the battery.There are protrusions on the battery holder additionally that will help the rubber pad to stay in place.
#### The connector
This will have two ports for discharging and one port for balance charging of the 2 batteries.This is attached to the main chassis with two screws of hexagonal type(though i have shown circular type for represantional purposes)

## Why my design?
1)It is modular and is easy for people to understand and use(It is a sort of like LEGO).The modularity also allows it to be customizable like you can a different switch,different robber pads,you can modify the ports of the connector and again attach it to the main chassis,you can customize the battery holder also according to your battery requirements and use it.There is plenty of room for all kinds of machinery like wireless module for sending data of battery health to your phone.<br />

3)It is easy to carry and can give enough space to the battery to expand.The springs acts as a shock absorber and prevent the battery from moving in all kinds of directions.<br/>

3)It doesnt much attachements to the robot you can drill holes with same dimension in the robot and keep the whole structure in place.Though the design is recommended to be used vertically you can drill hole on the side end of the chassis and attach it to the robot you are using with a screw and bolt.The handles will be used as an additional attachement.<br />

4)Suppose the battery surpasses all the above factors and still explodes then also the damage caused to the sheet metal will be minimum as most of the shock will be absorbed by springs and if there is anything left it will be transmitted to the rubber pads which may get ruptured and can be replaced with new ones.Moreover while explosion gases are release we have a opening for them to come out so that the user operating it will identify and can apply correction measures such as turning off the robot etc.This problem will not be addressed by a box type module or a design that is too compact since the gases released may not have enough space to expand and hence can cause a massive scale damage to the battery casing.

5)The attachement of almost everything has been achieved via magnets which reduces human effort for seperating the module into its components and hence it user friendly 
## What changes can you make to this design so that it is suitable for your use?
1)It is originally designed for two batteries but depending on your requirement the main chassis length can be extended and you can add additional volatage monitors and switches on the top of the chassis.Likewise you can decrease the length of the chassis when your requirement is too small such as 1 battery<br />

2)The axle kind of holders can be designed in any shape and can be put in any location depending on your need.<br />

3)You can add a heat insulating medium in the orignally designed battery holder or you can devise a mechansim for measuring the temperature of the battery and dynamically reporting that to the main server.
 
But for a small scale purpose you can reduce this to a size for only one battery.
